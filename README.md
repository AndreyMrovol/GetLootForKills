# GetLootForKills

So I thought things can get a bit unfair sometimes with enemies, so I made this mod to give players a reward for killing enemies.

So far all enemies(even modded) will drop items(even modded) and all of this can be configged. This includes what items will drop, the amount of item drops based on a given range, the scrap value based on a given range, and the chance it will drop out of 1000.
