# GetLootForKills

So I thought things can get a bit unfair sometimes with enemies, so I made this mod to give players a reward for killing enemies.
So far all enemies(even modded) will drop items(even modded) and all of this can be configged. This includes what items will drop, the amount of item drops based on a given range, the scrap value based on a given range, and the chance it will drop out of 1000.

The following example drops a random item with a chance to drop 0-3 of a random item of a value between 0-100 with a 100% chance of dropping the random items. Example: RANDOM, 0, 3, 0, 100, 1000

The example below this will drop a vanilla item called Flask with a chance to drop 1-1 of a value between 50-150 with a 10% chance of dropping the flask item. Example: Flask, 1, 1, 50, 150, 100

This last example will drop nothing. Example: NONE

If you want to drop a random item without actually configging it just leave the line empty.
